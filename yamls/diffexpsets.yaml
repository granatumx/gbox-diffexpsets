  subtitle: Reduce grouped data and transpose to determine genes of interest
  description: >
    If we have labeled or clustered the assay of cells, we can create a mean and standard deviation for each gene's
    behavior in the group. We can then create a feature vector for each gene. Genes with similar expression behavior
    will be grouped together on a downstream analysis such as UMAP plotting.
